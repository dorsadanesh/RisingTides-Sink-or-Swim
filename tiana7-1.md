Soon enough, they were seated in Tommy’s car with Smithers taking them down the highway. Tiana watched as upscale shopping districts and sleek cars transformed into smaller buildings, weedy lawns, and old manual vehicles running on broken up streets. When she glanced out the corner of her eye, Tommy seemed shocked by the change in scenery. 

After some time, the car rolled to a stop. When Tommy saw where they were, he furrowed his brows. “Um…Smithers, is this the right place?”

“It’s the right place,” Tiana said before Smithers could respond. “Trust me.”

Tiana got out of the car and shut the door. They were standing on a residential street—or at least, whatever was left of it. What should have been a row of houses and parked cars was instead a mess of mud and debris. A car was pushed halfway up a tilted tree trunk. Loose wooden planks and lattices were thrown against walls. And throughout it all, there was a vague stench, too. 

“What is that smell?” Tommy asked, covering his nose. 

“There are a lot of storm drains around here,” Tiana explained. She remembered asking her parents the same thing, a long time ago. “They overflowed and must have mixed with trash. It’s all sludge.”

Tommy tentatively ventured into the ruined yard, pushing at an upturned pot with his shoe. “When did this happen?”

“During the flash flood that happened last weekend.”

“But nothing even happened! I mean, it was just some light rain. How did it cause all this?”

“It was light rain for Northtown,” Tiana emphasized. She gestured around them with a sweep of her arm. “For Southside, it was flooding. There’s lots of reasons why. For example, Northtown has a lot more lawns and trees. Southside is all paved.”

“What does that have to do with anything?”

“Pavement doesn’t absorb runoff water. Where is all the rain gonna go?” Tiana could tell from Tommy’s expression that this was the first time he’d ever thought about that. 

“The buildings aren’t built as strong here as they are in Northtown. The seawall, too,” Tiana continued. “So when they get knocked down once, they’re put back up weaker than before, until eventually even a light storm would be enough to cause damage.” 

“But… but the government,” Tommy tried. “Why don’t they help? Or put more money into fixing the seawall, at least?”

“Why would they?” Tiana shrugged. “Southside isn’t where the money is at. Northtown is. To them, there must be no reason to help a place that’s always been this way.”

“That’s… that’s awful. I’m sorry.”

“We don’t need pity,” Tiana said, not unkindly. She turned to him, her expression firm and determined as ever. “We need change.” 

Tommy looked stunned, turning to take in more of the scene. Feeling hopeful from his reaction, Tiana suggested, “Why don’t we walk around more? I’ll show you the seawall.”

This time, Tommy had no complaints. They got into the car again and Smithers brought them closer to the shore. As they got out and began walking, Tiana pointed out the state that the seawall was in. 

“See all these cracks and fissures? The wall goes on for miles, but it’s not well kept,” she explained. “It’s practically useless, the way it is now.”

As they kept walking, they spotted several figures in the distance, hunched by a portion of the wall. Curiosity got the best of them and they approached, slowing when they were noticed by a woman. 

“Good morning,” the woman greeted.

Tiana nodded back, hesitating before asking, “What are you doing?”

The woman turned back to her associates. One of them was crouching on the ground with a bucket of what looked like cement, using a trowel to slather it onto the seawall. “There’s a big crack here that we want to seal while the tide is low.” 

“Oh…” They stepped down and joined the group to take a closer look. It was a very large crack they were trying to seal, but there was a bigger issue. “If you don’t mind me asking, what difference will that make? I mean, there’s miles of seawall and most of it is damaged.”

Her question prompted more attention from the rest of the group. One man replied,  “Even a little change is better than no change. We could all look at this damaged seawall and think, ‘There’s no point. It’s too torn up to fix.’ But if we picked a crack to fix every day, things would eventually have to get better, wouldn’t they?” 

Tiana and Tommy exchanged a glance. Then Tommy asked, “What if things don’t get better? What if you’re all trying to fix this seawall now, but something happens that makes everything worse?”

The man tilted his head, regarding them for a moment. “Our group is called Justice in Southside. Have you heard about us before?”

They both shook their heads. Despite living in Southside her whole life, Tiana didn’t really get involved with the community. 

“We try to help families hit by floods, collect and distribute food, and we try to fix the seawall where we can,” the man said. “And we also demand justice from the local government and companies that make it harder for us to live here. Things can always get worse, but if we do nothing, they definitely won’t get better.” 

Hearing their words with Tommy by her side filled Tiana with a renewed sense of hope, although it was also mixed with a little bit of doubt. Could they really make a difference if they joined? Or would it all be in vain?
