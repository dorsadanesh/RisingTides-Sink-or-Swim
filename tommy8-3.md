In the coming days, Tommy thought a lot about his last conversation with Tiana. No matter how much he sought to forget it and return to the way his life had been, he could not. Her words seemed to haunt him at unexpected moments.

Am I really not different at all? he thought to himself. Was he really the same as all those people around him who looked down on others?

No, certainly not. Those people never would’ve even been friends with someone like Tiana. He tried to console himself with these thoughts, but he couldn’t help but wonder what Tiana was up to. She hadn’t been coming to school or the internship since they fought. 

Stuck in his idle thoughts, Tommy scrolled through his phone blankly, seeking some kind of respite from his confusion. He came across yet another ONN news reel.

“Breaking news” said the ONN anchorman. Tommy sighed. Every piece of news seemed to be constantly breaking.

 “A flood of the highest intensity seen in the past 30 years hits the Southside neighborhood, rendering the area basically uninhabitable until the area is sweeped. The city’s disaster service as well as the Red Cross are on the scene, helping provide essential supplies to those who have lost their homes. It remains to be seen what will be done about a situation that experts call gross negligence by the city government, which has repeatedly failed to successfully relocate housing or rebuild failing infrastructure.”
