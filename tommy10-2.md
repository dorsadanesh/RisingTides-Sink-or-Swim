## TOMMY’S RECKONING

Long after he returned back to Northtown, Tommy would still think back on Tiana’s words. You people all live in your own little bubble and don’t care about anything going on outside. Tommy had always prided himself on being different from the Brighton kids; for being better, somehow morally superior. But he realized, now, that he hadn’t really done much to warrant that opinion of himself. If anything, the only difference between him and the other Brighton kids was that he knew better yet still kept his head down. Still feared making change.

And yet, how could he make change? Visiting Southside was easy. Fixing it was harder. He was just a student, and even worse, if he wanted to truly make a difference, it all went back to Earthandsea—and his mother. His mother, who he only saw for two more minutes than her colleagues. His mother, who he couldn’t even oppose on matters of breakfast. How was he supposed to challenge her whole life’s work? 

Was it even worth putting his whole lifestyle into jeopardy to help some neighborhood he’d never even stepped foot in before today?
