In the end, despite everything, Tiana chose to worry about herself before worrying about Southside.

There were lots of things she thought in efforts to console herself. I’m just one person. I couldn’t have made a difference anyway. I have a future at stake. She tried convincing herself that the only future worth investing in was one at Brighton, and Earthandsea. 
As the fishery in Southside was built and the following wreckage ensued, Tiana’s parents decided to move out of Southside and try finding someplace inland to rebuild their lives. They offered Tiana a chance to join them.

She declined. Her future was at Brighton. 

As the years passed, her success seemed to parallel the state of Southside in reverse. She graduated with honors; her old elementary school in Southside got shut down. She got invited to social events filled with the elite; neighborhoods of people who’d been living in Southside for generations dissipated, like sugar in water. Eventually, Tiana got her first entry level job with Earthandsea itself. 

Disease broke out in Southside from the contaminated water. 

Tiana wished she could say she had no regrets, but even that would be a lie. The connections, jobs, and money she’d coveted for so long only seemed to fill her with resentment. This resentment strained her friendship with Tommy, too. She was surrounded by more people than ever, but had never been lonelier in her life. 

She’d gotten everything that she could have ever wanted, but at what cost?
