Tommy has completely changed the kind of person he is. His friendship with Tiana is as strong as ever. After his conversation with his mother about reducing her impact on Southside, he was able to convince his mom to reduce the impact of the fish farm on southside and had her start a food bank in Southside for the families who lost their homes, jobs, and access to food. 

Tommy and his mom made it a weekly event that they would go volunteer in Southside together. Their relationship went from very short, substanceless conversations to actually spending time with each other and getting to know each other.  

Tommy has also joined Justice for Southside with Tiana so they can together fight against the system that is disproportionately affecting communities like Southside. He is becoming the friend that Tiana always needed and vice versa. Their friendship is one where they push one another to be better. Both of them are becoming better humans and advocates for the environment.  

Tommy learned to stand up for what is right even if it meant having to have a difficult conversation with his mom and witnessing the sad reality of some peopleâ€™s lives. He was able to acknowledge the privilege he had and used that to do better.

As Tommy grows up, he continues to be an avid environmentalist and climate change activist. He joins advocacy groups like Justice for Southside, alongside Tiana and they grow up to be well known in their community for fighting against climate change and those who contribute to it.
