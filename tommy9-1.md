Although he didn’t know what would come after, he knew he needed to go there in person and see the situation for himself.

Mother told you not to go there! said the cautious voice in his head. That’s true, she did.

But, Tommy thought, I can’t always do everything mother says.

To him, this was a revolutionary rebellion, and one whose consequences he would deal with afterwards. 

“Smithers,” called Tommy.

“Yes, sir,” replied Smithers in his usual polite robot voice, as his user interface screen appeared in front of Tommy. 

“Bring the G-Wagon around, we’re going to Southside.”

“That’s a restricted area sir, Madam Jones has banned me from taking you there.”

The time had finally come for Tommy to use his one secret weapon that he had kept to himself all these years – Smithers’ manual override code. He had learnt it long ago when his mother was first installing the system, and he figured it would one day be useful. 

“Manual override Smithers, code 0812,” said Tommy. Ironically, the code was his birthday. A tense moment followed as a loading bar appeared on Smithers’ screen. Tommy felt his heart beating at top speed. 

“Of course, sir,” said Smithers. 

With that, the garage doors opened and Tommy headed off to Southside.
