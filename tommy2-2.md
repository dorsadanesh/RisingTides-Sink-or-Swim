Bored by the city news, Tommy continued scrolling. 

Suddenly, Tommy was shaken from his thoughtfulness by the sound of heels clicking down the marble-tiled hall. He turned in his seat to see his mother, Ivy Jones, sweep into the room like a strong gust of wind, hair coiffed and clothes ironed to picture-perfection. A manicured hand plucked up a croissant while she gave him a critical once-over.

“Seems like your blazer fits well,” she said. “Good thing we got that tailor to come fix it. The shoulders were dreadfully baggy otherwise.”

A renowned industrialist, Ivy had built the Earthandsea Corporation from a small hatchery to the largest chain of hatcheries and fisheries on this side of the planet. Perhaps as a side effect of this accomplishment, she was now a ruthless perfectionist.

“I’ve told Smithers to plan your day,” she continued, circling around the table to pick up a strawberry. It joined the croissant on her plate, untouched. “It’s the first day of the year so be sure to start strong. He’ll take you to violin class after school at 3:30, piano class at 5 o’clock, your language studies tutor at 6 and your business tutor at 7. Isn’t that right, Smithers?” she said.

“Yes, ma’am,” Smithers dutifully responded. “It has been planned as you requested.” 

Tommy sighed. “Can’t I skip the business tutor for today? It’s the first day of school…” Before even finishing his sentence, he could tell from his mother’s displeased expression that she wouldn’t agree. 

“If you want to take over the company from me one day, you can’t just skip the essentials, Tommy! Success does not come to those who take breaks.”  

Ivy’s face softened marginally as she looked at him. “You understand I only want the best for you, right?” 

“Yes, mother,” Tommy mumbled back. This was often the story in his life. His mother wanted the best for him, no matter the cost. 

“Good. Now be a good boy and do as Smithers says.” She patted him on the shoulder, briefly nodding in approval at the insignia on his blazer, before turning on her heel and exiting the dining room with purpose. 

Having lost the battle with his mother once more, Tommy resigned to his fate. He got into his Mercedes G-Wagon, powered by the Smithers self-driving system, and headed to school.
