After revealing what she had learned that day in the systems filing room of the Earthandsea Corporation’s office, Tiana felt herself settle. If she had remained silent, she would have had that weight on her chest for the rest of her life.

“That must have taken a lot of courage to tell us, kid” said the man from Justice for Southside, who Tiana later learned was the regional organizer of the group. 

“I couldn’t lie to myself anymore. Southside is my home, and I want to protect it” said Tiana, with a look of renewed determination. She was sure she made the right choice. 

In the following days, Tiana was part of planning a protest against the new fishery development, and worked side by side with others from her community to do so. As someone who had always only worked for herself, Tiana had never felt so fulfilled as when she worked with others in service of a common goal. One thing nagged at her though – Tommy. She had to tell him about her decision. 

“Woah,” said Tommy, with a look of utter shock when Tiana had told him about the devastation in Southside, and her eventual decision to protest the development. He was silent in contemplation for a moment, before responding.

“That was very noble of you, Tiana” said Tommy, with a proud smile. Tiana was flabbergasted. She had not known her friend to ever engage in emotional statements, and certainly did not expect him to react positively to this information.

“I think I was a bit lost myself, since I’d never known how much damage Earthandsea would actually cause. I didn’t tell you this, but I looked into the situation myself after we found out about it that day, and I knew it wasn’t right” said Tommy, with a wistful look on his face. 

Tiana remembered the once apathetic rich kid who couldn’t be bothered to care about anything around him. That kid was now unrecognizable, and she was proud of how far her friend had come. 

Thus, Tiana became an advocate for her community and used her voice to fight those who weren’t able to. Since joining Justice for Southside, she became a more passionate and vocal person. She realized that when people come together, they can make a difference in the world. 

As a collective, Justice for Southside protested against Earthandsea’s new construction. A group of hundreds of protesters were in the streets marching towards Earthandsea headquarters in order to prevent the development. Southside and neighboring communities all came together to fight for something together that would affect them all. 

Luckily for Tiana, she didn’t do it alone. Tommy joined her and the two of them fought for the future of Tiana’s community. 

After a hard fight, the protest and resulting movement was successful. Due to media attention and worldwide support for the cause, lawmakers of the county sided with Justice for Southside and voted to enact regulations to protect vulnerable communities like Southside. They were able to stop the construction of the fish farm and have a conversation with Ivy Jones about what the future of her fish farms will look like and how she can be a better ally for the communities she has harmed. To her credit, she was receptive.

Tiana and Tommy continued to build their friendship and embarked on a journey of advocacy work. They continued to help out their communities and became climate change activists. 

After everything Tiana learned on this journey, she began to realize that being from Southside was something to be proud of and embrace. Her family continually supported her through anything and she decided to return the sentiment. Her family began to truly support one another and built a strong bond that led to embracing Southside and helping their neighbors.
