# Part 3: The Internship

From there, brunch turned into lunch, which turned into sitting next to each other in class. Soon, Tommy and Tiana hanging out at school became a routine. Tommy partly wondered whether they were just sticking with each other out of necessity—a lack of options, so to speak—but even recognizing this fact did not stop Tommy from looking forward to going to school for the first time in… well, ever. 

He couldn’t remember ever having a friend. A real, true friend (while Smithers was nice, he was also not human). 

Tiana, for her part, was a novelty to Tommy. She was both wickedly smart and confident, although after a while Tommy began to notice that she showed her nervousness in her own way. She was outspoken, yet intentionally vague about herself at the same time. The ‘small town on the other side of the country’ she mentioned in class was never named, although she did let slip that it was by the ocean. While he was intrigued, Tommy wasn’t too interested in prying. Everyone had things they kept to themselves. After all, it took him three whole days to tell her he was the son of Ivy Jones. Her reaction was about as much as he expected.

“Ivy Jones is your mom?” exclaimed Tiana, her eyes comically wide. She sputtered and pointed between him and the screen of her notebook, where the details of their internship—the very thing that prompted him to confess the truth—were written. “You’re Ivy Jones’ son?”

“Two very true facts, yes,” Tommy said. 

“But–but–Earthandsea is huge!” Tiana cried. “Are you going to inherit it?”

“Probably.”

“You’re so casual about it,” Tiana remarked, her eyes growing even bigger than before. “Ohh. Is that how we got assigned to Earthandsea for our internship? Because of your mom?”

“How should I know?” Tommy replied. He was annoyed, but tried not to show it. He didn’t like thinking about these things, let alone talking about them at great length. It was easier to just ignore things that he didn’t like. “Everyone at this school is like that. You won’t find anyone whose parents don’t own a big business or practice.”

Tiana fell silent upon hearing this comment. Tommy realized too late that she was probably the sole exception to that statement.

The following week, their internship began. In preparation for the day, Tiana had been busy absorbing as many details about the Earthandsea Corporation as she could, from its headquarters to the company manifesto. By the time they arrived at the company campus, she was a diehard fan. 

“The building is huge!” she whispered to Tommy, who had grown up seeing this building and could only smile faintly back at her. The two of them were being led inside by an excitable employee who kept looking back expectantly at Tommy. 

When they finally entered, the person who stood waiting made both Tommy and Tiana freeze in shock.

“Hi, you two.” said Ivy Jones, leaning elegantly against the receptionist’s table. She dismissed the employee who’d been leading them inside with one quick wave of her hand. Out of the corner of his eye, Tommy saw Tiana’s begin to fidget. She was clearly nervous, and for good reason. “Thanks for coming in. Welcome to Earthandsea Co!”

“Thank you for having us!” Tiana squeaked. Tommy settled for a wary nod. He wasn’t used to seeing his mother outside of their short interactions at home.

“Your roles will primarily focus on community projects and gathering qualitative information for our database,” Ivy said, straightening up. She picked up two lanyards from the desktop and held them out. “Here, your name cards.” Tiana reached out with shaking hands while Tommy took his apathetically. 

“Official company name card!” he heard Tiana whisper, barely able to contain her excitement. 

“There’s always a lot to do in a big company like ours. So, you’ll be getting started today.” Ivy smiled, gesturing to Tommy. “Luckily, Tommy has grown up in this world, so you two have no need for additional training. I trust you can show Tiana everything she needs to know, yes?”

“I promise I’m a quick study!” Tiana promised while Tommy sighed. 

“Yes, mother.” he said, avoiding the piercing gaze of his mother. 

“Good.” Ivy consulted the vintage Apple™ watch on her wrist for a moment. “I have a meeting to run to. Smithers is updated with the company’s agenda if you have any questions—all you have to do is ask. Good luck.” 

Without further ado, she turned around and marched off, her heels clicking on the polished concrete floors. 

Tommy turned to Tiana, who seemed as though she’d seen a ghost. 

“I can’t believe I just met Ivy Jones,” she said, clutching her name card to her chest. 

“Me neither,” Tommy said dryly. “Come on, I’ll show you how to log into the system.”
