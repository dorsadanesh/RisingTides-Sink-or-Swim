In the end, though, she couldn’t bring herself to keep pretending nothing was wrong. The guilt would eat her from the inside out if she tried. 

“I think I’ll go on a walk,” she said instead, heading to the door to pull her shoes on. “I’ll eat when I come back.”

“Tiana…” Her parents looked at each other, but none tried to stop her. “Alright. Call us if you need anything.”

She nodded at her parents and pulled a jacket on. “Yeah. I will.”

As she walked outside this time, she let her thoughts veer towards the direction she’d been avoiding. The little hill that protected her family’s house probably wouldn’t be much help after the fishery was built. The restaurant, too, would continue to struggle with such little seafood coming in, eventually having to close down. Even beyond her own life, what of the people who lived closer to the shore? What about the people who couldn’t afford to move? What would happen to them? 

Could she really leave and attend Brighton like none of that was happening? 

As she got lost in her thoughts, Tiana found herself walking along the seawall by the shore. It was visibly cracked and, in some parts, completely decimated. The government made no efforts to fix it, and private property owners found no reason to expend money into fixing something that wasn’t their problem. 

However, as Tiana kept walking, she spotted several figures in the distance, hunched by a portion of the wall. Curiosity got the best of her and she approached, slowing when one of them looked up and noticed her. 

“Good morning,” the woman greeted.

Tiana nodded back, hesitating before asking, “What are you doing?”

The woman turned back to her associates. One of them was crouching on the ground with a bucket of what looked like cement, using a trowel to slather it onto the seawall. “There’s a big crack here that we want to seal while the tide is low.” 

“Oh…” Tiana stepped down and joined the group to take a closer look. It was a very large crack they were trying to seal, but there was a bigger issue. “Um, if you don’t mind me asking, what difference will that make? I mean, there’s miles of seawall and most of it is damaged.”

Her question prompted more attention from the rest of the group. One man replied,  “Even a little change is better than no change. We could all look at this damaged seawall and think, ‘There’s no point. It’s too torn up to fix.’ But if we picked a crack to fix every day, things would eventually have to get better, wouldn’t they?” 

Tiana fidgeted with her fingers. “What if things don’t get better? What if you’re all trying to fix this seawall now, but something happens that makes everything worse?”

The man tilted his head, regarding her for a moment. “Our group is called Justice in Southside. Have you heard about us before?”

Tiana shook her head. Despite living in Southside her whole life, she didn’t really get involved with the community. 

“We try to help families hit by floods, collect and distribute food, and we try to fix the seawall where we can,” the man said. “And we also demand justice from the local government and companies that make it harder for us to live here. Things can always get worse, but if we do nothing, they definitely won’t get better.” 

Tiana stalled, staring at the crack they were trying to patch up. Could they really make a difference this way? 

And if she joined, could she make a difference, too? Or was it all in vain?
