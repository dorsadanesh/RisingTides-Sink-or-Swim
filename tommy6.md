## Part 4: THE FALLING OUT

As promised, Tiana was a quick study. Tommy showed her around the office, pointed out which areas had human workers and which employed AI, and taught her how to use her premade company account to access resources and files.

 Tiana dutifully jotted down notes while she followed him around, stopping every so often to admire things as mundane as the Holistic Coffee Machine (a self-automated coffee machine, which could infer the customer’s current preference for coffee based on their body temperature, breathing, and heart rate, amongst other factors). The internship became a new addition to their daily routine; now, instead of being carted off to lessons after school, he would go to Earthandsea HQ with Tiana. Amazingly, he found himself enjoying his time there. The place that had never been anything but a liability to him became a place where fond memories were made (like when the Holistic Coffee Machine spat coffee all over Tiana the first time she tried to use it. Tommy couldn’t remember any other time he laughed so hard his ribs hurt).

After a couple weeks, they found their new task of research leading them to one of the many system file rooms at Earthandsea. The few employees inside took one look at them before gathering their items and leaving with respectful nods to Tommy. 

“They’re not going to stay?” Tiana asked. 

“I prefer to work alone, so they know to leave when I’m here.”

Tiana shook her head in amazement, opting to sit down instead of responding. She rolled her chair up in front of one of the massive screens that lined the tables and logged in with her new credentials. “We’re looking for a specific import report?”

“Yeah, that’s our first task.” Tommy unceremoniously plopped into another chair and pulled out his phone. “Search engines don’t have access to the more confidential stuff, so we can’t use AI for this one. We’ll have to look manually.” Despite his continual usage of the word ‘we’, he showed no signs of getting to work.

“Are you going to help me find this document or what?” asked Tiana.

“I'm training you by letting you spread your wings,” said Tommy. Tiana rolled her eyes, deciding not to bother since he had spent time training her, and started looking through the file system.. 

About half an hour ticked by in the silence of the file room, with Tiana clicking through in search of the report while Tommy messed around on his phone. Beginning to get fed up with the lack of results, Tiana clicked through a random chain of folders, pausing and backtracking when her eyes snagged on a familiar name. Did I see that right? She clicked back and leaned in when her suspicions were confirmed. The file was labeled SOUTHSIDE_44-45, the name of her neighborhood. 

Temptation beat her conscience and Tiana decided to open the file. She’d only just begun to skim the first few lines when a frown formed on her face. She couldn’t make sense of what she was reading. Redevelopment? Collateral damage? Necessary project?

“What is all this?” she muttered. Unbeknownst to Tiana, those words were set to activate Smithers’ ever so helpful system. His voice rang out the second she finished her thought, causing her to jump in her seat.

“Hello, Tiana. I can help you with that. The file SOUTHSIDE_44-45 reports plans for another fishery to be built offshore the Southside area in the upcoming months. To generalize, construction would be greatly beneficial to Earthandsea Co. There would be some collateral damage impacting Southside residents; for example, water contamination, and impacts on the seawall surrounding the neighborhood. However, the benefits objectively outweigh the costs—” 

“Stop!” Tiana cried out, standing up and slamming her hand on the table. The room was promptly plunged into silence. She stood rigid as she tried to process everything Smithers had just dumped on her. When she looked over to Tommy, he’d only just looked up from his phone. “Did you know about this?”

“What? About the new fishery?” He shrugged. “There’re always new ones being built. Why?”

“But—but the collateral damage!” Tiana waved wildly at the screen. “Contaminated waters and impacts on the seawall. That means more disease, more flooding!”

Tommy scooted his chair up and took a cursory look at the screen. “Well, the residents will be compensated. See here?” He pointed to a line under the ‘collateral damages’ section of the report. “Each family will get one-hundred thousand dollars. That’s a lot, right?”

Tiana stared at Tommy in disbelief. “Tommy, that can hardly buy a one bedroom apartment, let alone relocate a whole family.”

Tommy prickled at her scrutiny. “Well, they can move somewhere else where it’s cheaper,” he said, feeling defensive for reasons he couldn’t figure out. “Besides, if they just fixed their seawalls, there would be less flooding.”

“Do you think it’s that obvious?” Tiana asked. “If fixing the seawalls were that easy, why wouldn’t they have done it already?”

Tommy hadn’t considered that. 

“Why do you care so much?” he asked instead. “It’s just some random neighborhood that you’ll never step foot in.”

“It’s my neighborhood!” Tiana shouted, clenching her fists. Tommy, stunned into silence, could only gape at her. “I literally grew up there—don’t talk about stepping foot inside!”

Tommy found his voice. “You said you were from a small town across the country! Why did you lie?”

“Because of people like you.” Tiana said coldly, jabbing her finger at him. “You think I didn’t notice all those other kids laughing at me? How Mr. Ellsworth called me an outsider? You people all live in your own little bubble and don’t care about anything going on outside.” She lowered her hand. “But I thought you were different.”

“I…” Tommy thought about all the other kids, the ones who thought they were above everyone else. He wasn’t like that! “I am different.”

“Really?” Tiana regarded him keenly, a glint in her eye. “Then prove it. Come with me to Southside so you can see everything for yourself.” 

“What?” Tommy gawked. He hadn’t been expecting her to suggest something like that. He knew he’d messed up, but to actually go there was…a lot. He didn’t even watch the news of things that didn’t affect him, let alone go visit them in person. 

“Well?” Tiana pushed. “What’ll it be?”
