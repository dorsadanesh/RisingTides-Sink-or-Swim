## TOMMY AND TIANA JOINT INVESTIGATION

“I…” Tommy wasn’t too keen on going, but at the same time, Tiana was asking. She was the only thing making school and the internship bearable.

Tiana stared at him harder. He felt the pressure mount in his chest until it was finally too much. “Fine, fine! Can you stop looking at me like that?”

Tiana leaned back and cheered.

“But not for too long,” Tommy hurriedly added. “Or else my mom will notice.”

“That’s not a problem.” Tiana was rapidly packing her things up. “You have your fancy car driven by Smithers, right? It’ll take half an hour to get there, tops.”

Tommy was still uncertain, but Tiana was resolute and already halfway out the door. He quickly gathered his things and ran after her, anxiously looking around all the while. 

“Stop looking so guilty,” Tiana said over her shoulder. “We aren’t doing anything wrong. Just think of it as research.”

Tommy had never known research to involve sleuthing around, but he couldn’t find a proper response. 

Soon enough, they were seated in his car with Smithers taking them down the highway. Tommy nervously looked out the window. He had never been this far out of Northtown, at least not without his mother seated next to him. Tommy watched as upscale shopping districts and sleek cars transformed into smaller buildings, weedy lawns, and old manual vehicles running on broken up streets. It was… an unappealing sight, to say the least. But Tiana didn’t seem to have any reaction to it, so Tommy thought it best to stay quiet. 

After some time, the car rolled to a stop. When Tommy saw where they were, he furrowed his brows. “Um…Smithers, is this the right place?”

“These are the coordinates that were provided to me by Tiana,” Smithers replied. “I assure you, it is the right location.”

Tiana got out of the car and shut the door. Feeling like there was no other choice, Tommy hurried out and followed her. Once he was out, though, he couldn’t help but gape, turning in a slow circle. 

They were standing on a residential street—or at least, whatever was left of it. What should have been a row of houses and parked cars was instead a mess of mud and debris. A car was pushed halfway up a tilted tree trunk. Loose wooden planks and lattices were thrown against walls. And throughout it all, there was a vague stench, too.

“What is that smell?” Tommy asked, covering his nose. 

“There are a lot of storm drains around here,” Tiana explained. “They overflowed and must have mixed with trash. It’s all sludge.”

Tommy tentatively ventured into the ruined yard, pushing at an upturned pot with his shoe. “When did this happen?”

“During the flash flood that happened last weekend.”

Tommy remembered getting an alert for that on his phone. “But nothing even happened! I mean, it was just some light rain. How did it cause all this?”

“It was light rain for Northtown,” Tiana emphasized. She gestured around them with a sweep of her arm. “For Southside, it was flooding. There’s lots of reasons why. For example, Northtown has a lot more lawns and trees. Southside is all paved.”

“What does that have to do with anything?”

“Pavement doesn’t absorb runoff water. Where is all the rain gonna go?”

Tommy blinked. He hadn’t even considered that. 

“The buildings aren’t built as strong here as they are in Northtown. The seawall, too,” Tiana continued. “So when they get knocked down once, they’re put back up weaker than before, until eventually even a light storm would be enough to cause damage.” 

“But… but the government,” Tommy tried. “Why don’t they help? Or put more money into fixing the seawall, at least?”

“Why would they?” Tiana shrugged. “Southside isn’t where the money is at. Northtown is. To them, there must be no reason to help a place that’s always been this way.”

“That’s…” Tommy tried thinking of solutions—some kind of miraculous try-doing-this! solution that, somehow, had not been thought of before. But it was an exercise in futility. Of course there was no singular cure for a problem that was woven together like a web. He’d thought before that Southside should just fix their seawall—but it clearly wasn’t that easy. Not for them. “That’s awful. I’m sorry.”

“We don’t need pity,” Tiana said, not unkindly. She turned to him, her expression firm and determined as ever. “We need change.” 

Long after the two of them returned back to Northtown, Tommy would still think back on Tiana’s words. You people all live in your own little bubble and don’t care about anything going on outside. We don’t need pity. We need change. Tommy had always prided himself on being different from the Brighton kids; for being better, somehow morally superior. But he realized, now, that he hadn’t really done much to warrant that opinion of himself. If anything, the only difference between him and the other Brighton kids was that he knew better yet still kept his head down. Still feared making change.

And yet, how could he make change? Visiting Southside was easy. Fixing it was harder. He was just a student, and even worse, if he wanted to truly make a difference, it all went back to Earthandsea—and his mother. His mother, who he only saw for two more minutes than her colleagues. His mother, who he couldn’t even oppose on matters of breakfast. How was he supposed to challenge her whole life’s work? 

Was it even worth putting his whole lifestyle into jeopardy to help some neighborhood he’d never even stepped foot in before today?
