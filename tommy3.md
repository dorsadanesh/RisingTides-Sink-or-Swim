## Part 2: A New Friend At School

Tommy hated school. 

It wasn’t because it was difficult. School had never been difficult for Tommy, nor should it have been with all the tutoring he did. School simply felt meaningless and boring. Other people hung out with their friends at lunch or spent time talking about their interests. Tommy didn’t have much of either one. Plus, he already knew what he would end up doing when he grew up – whatever his mother had planned for him. 

Upon entering Brighton through the tall wrought-iron gates, Smithers navigated the G-wagon into the roundabout where other students were being dropped off.

“A message from your mother. Shall I read it?” asked Smithers. 

“Of course, Smithers” responded Tommy, although he knew full well what his mother had to say.

Smithers played a voice message from Tommy’s mother.
“Make a good impression on your teachers, Tommy! Success comes to those that take initiative!” 

Tommy had heard these words more times than he could count. 

“Yes, mother,” Tommy replied. His passenger door popped open automatically as he made to get out.

“And have fun at school.” Tommy paused, looking back in surprise at the driver’s seat where Smithers’ hologram was being projected. “That’s a message from me.”

Of course it was Smithers, Tommy thought again, shutting the door. The car drove off not long after, leaving Tommy standing alone at the front gates to the school. 

The first day of school at Brighton was filled with excitement and fanfare. Around him, friends noisily reunited after long summers spent apart. Upperclassmen welcomed first-years with enthusiasm and taunts in equal parts. On his way to the first class of the day, Tommy saw many old faces—most of the school was the same group of people he’d shared classes with since kindergarten. Some of them waved to him, and he waved back to be polite. He didn’t remember their names, and he was sure they didn't know his.

As he walked into the crowded classroom, Tommy looked around and sighed in relief as he spotted an empty table near a window. Perfect. No awkward can-I-sit-here and sorry-it’s-saved-for-my-friend interactions today.

Chatter flowed in class as everyone around him talked to their friends about their summer escapades. Some classmates had gone to Bora Bora, some to Hawaii, and some to the New Maldives, which had been constructed only recently after most of the Old Maldives was submerged. Classic summer destinations for established families. Tommy had spent his summer taking courses in economics, so he felt he’d rather not share. 

As the clock struck 8 am, the morning bell rang and a lanky, bespectacled man strolled into class. He seemed obscenely happy for someone at work at 8 am.

“Good morning, class!” He somehow sounded even more cheerful than he looked. “I hope you all had a good break. My name is Mr. Ellsworth, and I am going to be your homeroom teacher for your first year here. I hope you are all proud of yourselves; attending this prestigious institution is no small matter. Welcome to Brighton Academy!”

More excited chatter and cheers erupted at his words. Mr. Ellsworth allowed it for a few moments before raising his hands in a placating motion. 

“All right, settle down, everyone,” he said. “Before we begin, I would like to introduce a new student to you all. Most of you must already know each other from years prior, but this student has earned a scholarship to attend Brighton, and as such, it will be your first time meeting her.” Mr. Ellsworth pushed up his glasses and sniffed. “It’s very rare for outsiders to come to this school.”

Whispers sounded around the classroom. Clearing his throat, Mr. Ellsworth motioned to the open door, waving the student in. A girl walked in a second later. 

She was short, and very serious-looking for a 14 year old girl. Her hair was pulled back tightly into a ponytail that burst into curls at the base of her neck, with only one stray curl escaping onto her forehead. Despite all the unfamiliar eyes and whispers filling the room, she seemed unfazed. She stared confidently ahead and briefly met Tommy’s gaze. Tommy panicked and looked away.  

“Why don’t you introduce yourself, my dear?” Mr. Ellsworth said. 

“Hello everyone, I’m Tiana,” she said, her voice ringing out clear as a bell. “Like Mr. Ellsworth said, I’m new here. I'm very honored to be here, and I’m excited to meet you all.”

“Where are you from?” A student in the middle of the room asked. For some reason, this elicited laughter. 

“A small town on the other side of the country,” Tiana replied, unbothered. “Got any more questions?”

When she was met with silence, Mr. Ellsworth cleared his throat again. “You can sit down. It seems like we are a full class, but… ah!” To Tommy’s horror, the teacher’s eyes landed right on him—and the empty seat next to him. “There’s a seat right there, near the back.”


Tiana strode through the class and sat right next to Tommy. When he chanced a glance over at her, she’d taken out her electronic notebook. It was an older model—2040, from the looks of it—and the cover was banged up at the edges. This was puzzling for Tommy, who had never seen anyone at school use anything other than the latest model. 

She twirled the electronic pen in her hand, fumbling and dropping it on the floor not a second later. So she is nervous, Tommy thought. The thought made him feel a strange camaraderie with his new classmate. Reaching down, he picked it up and handed it back to her.

“Thank you,” said Tiana, with a faint look of surprise.
