“You’re welcome,” said Tommy, who had decided not to introduce himself to his new tablemate. There wouldn’t really be any point, since he’d eat lunch alone and go off to his after school activities anyway. 

“I’m Tiana,” said the girl just then, looking at him intently. “I mean, you already know that because I just said it in front of everyone, but still. What’s your name?”

Tommy was taken aback. It had been a long time since someone had actually tried to make friends with him. 

“I-I’m Tommy,” he said nervously. “Nice to meet you.”

After a moment, she smiled back at him before looking at the board.
