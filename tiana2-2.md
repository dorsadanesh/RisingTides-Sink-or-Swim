The discussion seemed important, but Tiana wasn’t too worried about the specifics. In any case, she was trying her best to leave this neighborhood and her parents’ seafood restaurant as soon as possible. Plus, her parents always managed to figure it out somehow. 

Just then, Tiana’s father noticed that she’d entered.

“Ah, pumpkin! You’re here!” he said, throwing a stressed glance at Tiana’s mother.

“Why don’t you have some breakfast?” Tiana’s mother asked as she walked to the kitchen and produced a plate of eggs on toast seemingly out of thin air. It was clearly meant to be a distraction from whatever they’d been discussing at the table before—and Tiana rolled with it.

“No thanks, Mom. I’m not hungry,” said Tiana. In truth, she was too nervous to eat anything.

“Are you sure? It’s your first day, you should fuel up. What if they don’t have food you like at the dining halls there?” Tiana’s mother fretted. She bustled into the kitchen again and came back with a lunchbox. “Here, take this.”

“...Alright,” Tiana said reluctantly, turning to stuff the lunchbox into her backpack. She could not be seen carrying that around. 

“You’re sure you don’t need a mattress topper, right?”

“Mom, you saw my bed last week and even laid down on it. It’s plenty soft on its own.” Tiana decided to leave out the fact that it was a much nicer mattress than the one she had at home. 

“Make sure you always have your phone charged,” her mother ordered. She couldn’t seem to find one topic to stick on. “Reply to our texts! Don’t stay up too late studying. And don’t skip meals—”

“Dear,” her father interrupted. Tiana shot her father a thankful look as he put his hands on her mother’s shoulders. “We went over all this last week.”

Her mother wavered for a moment before sighing. “Oh, I know. I just can’t believe you’ll be moving out.” She approached Tiana and placed a hand on her cheek. “Visit on the weekends when you can” said her mother with a tearful smile.  

Tiana shifted under her mother’s attention. Some part of her did recognize that she’d be leaving home, and that she ought to be at least a little sad, but she was mostly itching to just finally get out. She turned away from her mother and hiked her bag up on her shoulder.

 “Right, I will,” she said. “I’m running late for the trolley. I’d better go.”

“Travel safe,” her father said. 

“I will!” She opened the front door and started down the steps.

“Yet another flood last night in the Southside community,” he said, staring intently at the camera. “It remains to be seen how the local government will handle the increasing string of weather disasters in this neighborhood as of late…”

Tiana continued running past. No matter how many reporters covered the situation, it didn’t seem like it would ever improve. The climate was changing and the Southside community seemed to be the sacrifice. All the more reason for Tiana to get out of here. 

An hour long trolley ride, a few bus stops, and a fifteen minute walk later, Tiana reached the high wrought-iron gates of Brighton Preparatory Academy. As she scanned her student ID at the front and walked on through, she saw the roundabout where many other students were getting dropped off. Strangely, none of the cars seemed to have drivers. Tiana had heard of AI driven cars before, but the cars in her own family and neighborhood were all old manual-driver models. 

It’s time, she thought to herself as she took a deep breath and walked into the building. Thanks to her visit last week, she knew where to go, but the school looked different when it was crammed with students. 

The first day of school at Brighton was filled with excitement and fanfare. Around her, friends noisily reunited after long summers spent apart. Upperclassmen welcomed first-years with enthusiasm and taunts in equal parts. 

At some point, she noticed a few other students that she’d seen during move-in last week—on-campus dwellers like herself. They had seemingly formed friend groups already, and tottered past in pairs and triplets. She wondered briefly when they’d had time to get to know each other, before realizing they likely already knew each other. Everyone at this school seemed to have prior connections with each other.

After ten minutes of careful walking, she finally reached her homeroom. As she walked into the crowded classroom, Tiana looked around for an empty seat. Due to her extra long commute to school, she’d arrived right before the bell and most of the class was already full. 

At last, she spotted an empty seat in the back of the room next to an aloof looking boy with spiky blonde hair. He seemed busy staring out the window until Tiana started to approach him. He met her gaze briefly, then seemed to look away with what seemed like panic. 

She took her seat next to the boy, who stared right ahead but seemed to steal glances at Tiana occasionally. Tiana wondered whether she should introduce herself to him.


“And text us when you get there!” Tiana’s mother called as she ran down the street. Tiana simply waved her hand above her head, not looking back. 

As she ran to the trolley stop, Tiana passed by a news van where a reporter was standing in front of a building that was hit particularly hard by the recent floods.

“Yet another flood last night in the Southside community,” he said, staring intently at the camera. “It remains to be seen how the local government will handle the increasing string of weather disasters in this neighborhood as of late…”
