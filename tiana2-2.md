The discussion seemed important, but Tiana wasn’t too worried about the specifics. In any case, she was trying her best to leave this neighborhood and her parents’ seafood restaurant as soon as possible. Plus, her parents always managed to figure it out somehow. 

Just then, Tiana’s father noticed that she’d entered.

“Ah, pumpkin! You’re here!” he said, throwing a stressed glance at Tiana’s mother.

“Why don’t you have some breakfast?” Tiana’s mother asked as she walked to the kitchen and produced a plate of eggs on toast seemingly out of thin air. It was clearly meant to be a distraction from whatever they’d been discussing at the table before—and Tiana rolled with it.

“No thanks, Mom. I’m not hungry,” said Tiana. In truth, she was too nervous to eat anything.

“Are you sure? It’s your first day, you should fuel up. What if they don’t have food you like at the dining halls there?” Tiana’s mother fretted. She bustled into the kitchen again and came back with a lunchbox. “Here, take this.”

“...Alright,” Tiana said reluctantly, turning to stuff the lunchbox into her backpack. She could not be seen carrying that around. 

“You’re sure you don’t need a mattress topper, right?”

“Mom, you saw my bed last week and even laid down on it. It’s plenty soft on its own.” Tiana decided to leave out the fact that it was a much nicer mattress than the one she had at home. 

“Make sure you always have your phone charged,” her mother ordered. She couldn’t seem to find one topic to stick on. “Reply to our texts! Don’t stay up too late studying. And don’t skip meals—”

“Dear,” her father interrupted. Tiana shot her father a thankful look as he put his hands on her mother’s shoulders. “We went over all this last week.”

Her mother wavered for a moment before sighing. “Oh, I know. I just can’t believe you’ll be moving out.” She approached Tiana and placed a hand on her cheek. “Visit on the weekends when you can” said her mother with a tearful smile.  

Tiana shifted under her mother’s attention. Some part of her did recognize that she’d be leaving home, and that she ought to be at least a little sad, but she was mostly itching to just finally get out. She turned away from her mother and hiked her bag up on her shoulder.

 “Right, I will,” she said. “I’m running late for the trolley. I’d better go.”

“Travel safe,” her father said. 

“I will!” She opened the front door and started down the steps.

“And text us when you get there!” Tiana’s mother called as she ran down the street. Tiana simply waved her hand above her head, not looking back. 

As she ran to the trolley stop, Tiana passed by a news van where a reporter was standing in front of a building that was hit particularly hard by the recent floods.
