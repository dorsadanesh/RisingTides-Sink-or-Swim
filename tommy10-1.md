## Seeing the Devastation

On the other side of the freeway, there was Southside. It was considerably lower in elevation than Northtown. As soon as they exited the freeway, the car encountered a narrow road with the ocean on one side. The waves were crashing into the seawall on the side of the road, which was cracked and broken in places. 

The elevation of the road was also not nearly high enough, as the waves at high tide flowed onto the road. The G-Wagon splashed through muddy water as it drove along this road. 

As they entered further into the neighborhood, Tommy saw collapsed homes with people digging desperately through the rubble. He saw people in Red Cross tents scattered throughout the area, seeking shelter, food and clean water. Others sought to heal their injuries. 

Further inland, he saw homes that had been warped by the sheer amount of water that looked on the verge of collapse. Yet, people continued to live in them, shoveling water out in buckets. 

This was not life, this was survival.
 
Tommy had never seen devastation of this scale, and it tugged at his heart like nothing else.
