Since this new student would be sitting at Tommy’s table, he decided to behave out of character and introduce himself. 

“H-hi, I’m Tommy,” he said. “It’s nice to meet you.”

For a brief moment, Tiana looked suspicious, until her expression melted into a friendly smile. 

“Thanks!” she said cheerfully. “It’s nice to meet you, too.”

Tommy was taken aback. In the upper echelons of society, people rarely went out of their way to acquaint themselves with outsiders, so he hadn’t heard anyone say it was nice to meet him in a long while.

“N-nice to meet you too,” he said, forgetting that he’d already said that. If Tiana noticed it, she didn’t say anything.
