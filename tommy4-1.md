Since this new student would be sitting at Tommy’s table, he decided to behave out of character and introduce himself. 

“H-hi, I’m Tommy,” he said. “It’s nice to meet you.”

For a brief moment, Tiana looked suspicious, until her expression melted into a friendly smile. 

“Thanks!” she said cheerfully. “It’s nice to meet you, too.”

Tommy was taken aback. In the upper echelons of society, people rarely went out of their way to acquaint themselves with outsiders, so he hadn’t heard anyone say it was nice to meet him in a long while.

“N-nice to meet you too,” he said, forgetting that he’d already said that. If Tiana noticed it, she didn’t say anything.

Class launched soon after that. Syllabi were instantaneously shared to everyone’s devices (Tiana’s notebook didn’t support this new feature, so Tommy shared it with her manually), and basic housekeeping was covered. After that, Mr. Ellsworth clapped his hands together. 

“Alright, students. This semester, we will be piloting a very special program for our business classes thanks to the generosity of our local companies. You all will be interning in pairs at an assigned company for a whole week!” 

Excited whispers broke out in class. Tommy simply groaned. He already knew which company he would likely be assigned to. 

“This will be a great experience for you all, but especially those of you who want to work in the world of business,” continued Mr. Ellsworth. “Your assigned companies will be posted online, and your internship starts next week. Best of luck!”

Tommy looked over at Tiana, curious about her reaction to all this. 

“I’ve never had an internship before!” she exclaimed with an excited glint in her eye. Tommy was envious of her enthusiasm. 

As the class checked their assigned companies, Tommy’s fears were confirmed. He was assigned to the Earthandsea Corporation. He wondered whether his mother had a hand in this, or whether it was simply fate. When he checked who his partner was, though, he paused.

“Looks like we’ve both been assigned to the same company!” said Tiana just then. She was practically jumping in her seat. “Earthandsea Co. Wow! They’re huge!”

“Oh, nice,” said Tommy. While it would be extreme to say that he was happy Tiana was his partner, she was also realistically his best choice, and so he was relieved. What luck that his new seatmate was also his partner.  “At least one of us is excited.”

Just then, the brunch bell rang. As usual, Tommy quickly put his belongings away, intending to find a quiet corner to spend the free time.  Before he could leave, he saw Tiana look up at him nervously from her seat. 

“Can you show me what food is good here?” she asked, twiddling her thumbs. “Oh—unless you already have plans.” 

 She was clearly anxious about her new school, a feeling that Tommy was well acquainted with.

After a moment, Tommy relented. It couldn’t hurt to eat with her once. “I don’t. And it’s my first time here too, so I suppose we can find out what’s good together.”
