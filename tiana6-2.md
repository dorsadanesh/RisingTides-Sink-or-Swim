After a few long moments, she slowly sat back down.

“Tiana?” Tommy asked again. 

“It’s nothing,” she said, a sour taste in her mouth. “I just… got spooked by Smithers.”

Tommy simply shrugged and looked back down at his phone. Tiana was left to stare at the Southside report again, which now seemed to mock her. Your fault, all the facts and figures seemed to say. Southside will perish and it’ll be all your fault. 

But I’m just one person! Tiana wanted to shout. I’m not even an adult. What am I supposed to do?!

Looking for anything else to do, Tiana pulled out her phone. It hardly saw any use during her time at Brighton, aside from texting and calling her parents. She opened a chat with her mother from two days ago. Her mother had asked if Tiana could visit during the weekend. Tiana had said she was too busy. Again. 

She still hadn’t visited since starting at Brighton all those weeks ago. 

Tiana found herself swiping through old photographs. Birthdays at the restaurant. Playing catch in the street with the neighbor kids. Walking along the shore on long summer days. There weren’t many pictures, but every single one elicited the same bitter, churning feeling in her stomach. 

“Oh, by the way,” Tommy spoke up, “what are you doing this weekend? If I tell Mom we’re working on homework for a few hours, we could probably ditch and take Smithers to go downtown. What do you think?”

Tiana frowned, still staring down at her phone. Was it because she knew Southside would be gone soon? Or was it homesickness hitting late? In any case, she couldn’t stop looking at the pictures. 

“Sorry, Tommy,” she said. She sent a text to her mom. “I’m going to visit home this weekend.”
