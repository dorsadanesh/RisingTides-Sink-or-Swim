The decision to confront his mother came easily to him in theory. When the time actually came to act it out, he couldn’t stop shaking. 

“Your heart rate is abnormally high,” Smithers helpfully commented. Tommy was currently pacing in his room, and had called upon the AI assistant to confirm that his mother was currently in her office. “Shall we engage in square breathing?”

“No thanks,” Tommy replied, though he did try to take deeper breaths. “Can you just tell me if Mother is in her office or not?” 

“She is,” Smithers replied. “However, in her schedule, the next two hours have been blocked off as working hours. Madam Jones will not be receptive to having a conversation with you right now.” 

“She won’t be receptive at all,” Tommy muttered, striding to the mirror to check his reflection. It was important that he looked clean and composed—somebody that Ivy Jones would take seriously. “Thank you, Smithers. That’ll be all.” 

Tommy snatched up his notebook before exiting his room and heading down the spiral staircase. His heartbeat grew increasingly louder with every step he took to his mother’s office until it was thundering in his ears as he stood in front of the grand double doors. Before Tommy could psych himself out, he raised his fist and knocked.

“I’m busy,” his mother’s voice rang out a second later. Tommy swallowed and pushed the door open. 

His mother’s office was tastefully decorated, with plush armchairs facing her desk and a rich plush rug underfoot. Wide french windows were flanked by velvet curtains, and mahogany bookshelves boasted selections of real paper books, something that had become a bit of a rarity. Throughout the space, all of her achievements shone through. Certificates and awards were dotted along the walls, placed in the bookshelves, and adorning her desk, where she was currently peering up at him from. 

“I said I’m busy,” she repeated. Her face remained as inscrutable as ever. “What’s so important that you couldn’t talk to Smithers about it?” 

Tommy had planned out talking points in his notebook, a structured flow of conversation that he was supposed to use to appeal to his mother, but instead of using his eloquent opener—Earthandsea is constantly growing, but is all growth truly beneficial?—he blurted, “You can’t build the fishery in Southside!”

Silence hung between them on a thread. His mother finally uttered a stunned, “Excuse me?”

“Um. I mean—that is—” Feeling his tongue twist itself into knots, Tommy sighed frustratedly and set his notebook on her desk. “I know what you’re planning for Southside, Mother. I saw it in the system filing room at HQ.” 

“I give you access to confidential information for the purpose of your internship, and you go and look through things you aren’t supposed to?” she asked. Her tone stayed carefully level despite her words. “That isn’t how you were taught, Tommy.”

“That’s not the point,” Tommy said. He was losing grip on the conversation. “Mother, please listen to me. If you build this fishery, Southside will become unlivable.”

“What would you know about that?”

“I saw it on the news.”

“The news sensationalizes things,” she said dismissively. “Their job is to make a story. It looks a lot worse than it is.”

“That’s not true. I was there in person!” Tommy only realized his mistake when his mother’s eyes flashed up to him. She slowly set her stylus down.

“You went there in person?” 

“I…” Tommy set his jaw. “Yes, I did.” 

 “Tommy…” She pinched the bridge of her nose. “What is this, a rebellious phase? You have no reason to go to a place like that. I’ve always told you not to go there for a reason.”

“It’s only because I went in person that I know things need to change!” he exclaimed. “The seawall is broken.The infrastructure isn’t able to take a lot of rain without flooding. The fishery will only contaminate the water and make it impossible for anyone to reasonably live there!” 

“We’re offering residents money to relocate.”

“Yeah, I saw that in the report. It’s not enough to relocate a whole family, not by a long shot,” Tommy replied, remembering Tiana’s words. “Mother, my friend Tiana is from Southside. She’s the one who told me about all this.”

“Oh, really?” his mother asked, eyes narrowing. “This is all because of her, is it?”

“Yes,” Tommy shot back. His desire to defend Tiana from his mother’s scrutiny caused any feelings of fear to disintegrate. “She’s the first person to ever care about me, so it only made sense to listen to what she had to say. And she’s right.”

For the first time, hurt flashed across his mother’s face. “What are you talking about? I care about you.”

“Forgive me for not realizing,” Tommy replied bitterly. To his embarrassment, he began choking up. “I couldn’t tell since I only see you five minutes a day.”

“Running a company like Earthandsea isn’t a walk in the park,” she said incredulously. “If I don’t put in all this work, how will it grow?” 

“How much do you want the company to grow, Mother? And why?” There was that eloquent opener. “When is it all enough?” 

“Everything I do is for you!” she burst. Tommy couldn’t do anything but stare in silence. He had never seen his mother break her composure—and her words, too, were surprising. “We started from nothing, Tommy. I built this from the ground up so that you wouldn’t have to go through what I did. The world can be an unforgiving place.” She shook her head. “I only want what’s best for you.” 

“I know,” Tommy said quietly. His anger had fizzled down to a sad understanding of his mother. She had always wanted the best for him, no matter the cost. But now Tommy knew that the price wasn’t one he would ever have to pay in his life, and that was the definition of injustice. “But I never wanted a huge company to inherit, or a bunch of fancy gadgets. I just wanted a real friend. And a mom, too.”

Ivy stared at him across the desk for what felt like a lifetime. Eventually, she slumped in her seat. “So, what? You want to cancel the construction of the fishery? That’s not an easy thing to do, especially so late down the line.” 

“I don’t expect it to be easy,” Tommy said. “But things need to change, Mother. We need to change.”

After a few more moments of silence, she dismissed him from her office, looking troubled. Tommy was afraid that he hadn’t gotten through to her, but an hour later, she sent him a voice note requesting that they have dinner together. Hope rose in his chest.

Indeed, change wasn’t always easy. But it was powerful once it was set into motion.
