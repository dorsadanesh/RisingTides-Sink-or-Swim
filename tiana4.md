## The Internship

From there, brunch turned into lunch, which turned into sitting next to each other in class. Soon, Tommy and Tiana hanging out at school became a routine. She’d leave her dorm room in the morning and wait for Tommy at the roundabout, and from there they’d spend the day together. Tiana partly wondered whether they were just sticking with each other out of necessity—a lack of options, so to speak—but even recognizing this fact did not prevent Tiana from feeling at ease in this new world due to Tommy being her friend. 

Tommy, for his part, was a curious individual. While he seemed shy and anxious at first, he was also strangely confident in his own way. He was clearly used to hanging out by himself at school and never seemed to care what others were doing. He also didn’t seem to try too hard in class, but somehow always did well. Tiana wondered where his nonchalance came from. 

He also never shared much about himself, but then again she hadn’t shared much about herself either. For all Tommy knew, Tiana was truly from the other side of the country. Everyone had things they kept to themselves. Just prior to the start of their internship, however, Tommy presented some shocking information. 

“Ivy Jones is your mom?” exclaimed Tiana, her eyes comically wide. She sputtered and pointed between him and the screen of her notebook, where the details of their internship were displayed. “You’re Ivy Jones’ son?”

“Two very true facts, yes,” Tommy said. 

Ivy Jones was the CEO of the Earthandsea Corporation, and a ruthless industrialist known for her iron fist and business acumen. To think that she was Tommy’s mother! Now Tiana knew where Tommy’s blasé nature came from. 

“But–but–Earthandsea is huge!” Tiana cried. “Are you going to inherit it?”

“Probably.”

“You’re so casual about it,” Tiana remarked, her eyes growing even bigger than before. She suddenly began to feel a distance between herself and Tommy, and wondered how much wealth Brighton Prep students might actually have. 

As if to confirm her contemplations, Tommy commented, “Everyone at this school is like that. You won’t find anyone whose parents don’t own a big business or practice.”

Tiana fell silent upon hearing this comment. Tommy’s gaze softened for a moment upon seeing her face, as if he realized she was the exception to this rule. 

“It’s okay though, you’re smarter than any of them,” he said hurriedly. He was clearly trying to make up for his earlier indiscretion. 

“Thanks…” said Tiana with a dry smile. 

By the time their internship began, however, all was forgiven. In preparation for the day, Tiana had been busy absorbing as many details about the Earthandsea Corporation as she could, from the layout of its headquarters to the company manifesto. She needed to be as prepared as possible for her eventual meteoric rise through the ranks of the company. 

Eventually, the big day arrived and they found themselves in the huge lobby of the Earthandsea Building. From the entrance, you could see 20 floors up with walls made entirely of glass. The polished concrete floors looked almost like water as the light danced across them, making click-clack noises as dozens of employees hustled and bustled around. 

“This building is huge!” whispered Tiana to Tommy, who met her with a look of disinterest and borderline disdain to be there. The two of them were being led inside Earthandsea headquarters by an excitable employee who kept looking back expectantly at Tommy. 

When they finally reached the front desk, the person who stood waiting made both Tommy and Tiana freeze in shock.

“Hi, you two,” said Ivy Jones, leaning elegantly against the receptionist’s table. She dismissed the employee who’d been leading them inside with one quick wave of her hand. While she was not a physically intimidating lady, Ivy Jones had a commanding air about her that made Tiana tremble where she stood.  “Thanks for coming in. Welcome to Earthandsea Co!”

“Thank you for having us!” Tiana squeaked, starstruck upon seeing the Ivy Jones in the flesh. Tommy settled for a wary nod. 

“Your roles will primarily focus on community projects and gathering qualitative information for our database,” Ivy said, straightening up. She picked up two lanyards from the desktop and held them out. “Here, your name cards.” Tiana reached out with shaking hands while Tommy took his apathetically. 

“Official company name card!” Tiana whispered, barely able to contain her excitement. 

“There’s always a lot to do in a big company like ours. So, you’ll be getting started today.” Ivy smiled, gesturing to Tommy. “Luckily, Tommy has grown up in this world, so you two have no need for additional training. I trust you can show Tiana everything she needs to know, yes?”

“I promise I’m a quick study!” Tiana exclaimed. Ivy Jones was such an inspiration—a self made woman, someone who started from the bottom. Tiana would make sure to do everything in her power to leave a good impression on her.  

“Yes, mother,” Tommy sighed.

“Good.” Ivy consulted the vintage Apple™ watch on her wrist for a moment. “I have a meeting to run to. Smithers is updated with your agenda if you have any questions—all you have to do is ask. Good luck.” 

Without further ado, she turned around and marched off, her heels clicking on the polished concrete floors. 

Tiana turned to Tommy, clutching her name card to her chest as she watched Ivy’s retreating figure. “I can’t believe I just met Ivy Jones,” she said.

“Me neither,” Tommy said dryly. Tiana didn’t realize the strangeness of his statement, starstruck as she was. 

“Come on, I’ll show you how to log into the system” said Tommy, as he led her to the elevators.
