Tommy wanted to say that he’d made change. He wanted to say that he was a revolutionary, a great catalyst for better things in the world. 

But in the end, he was just the same old Tommy, no different from anyone else at Brighton who carried on like nothing was happening outside. 

Tiana had been hopeful about him at the start; he could tell. She’d ask him whether he would be able to talk to his mother, or attend this teach-in, or go to that protest. Tommy tried giving the best non-answers he could. Sorry, I’m feeling under the weather today. I have this meeting to go to that I really can’t miss. I need to meet with Mr. Ellsworth after school today. He wasn’t sure who believed the excuses less between the two of them. Eventually, Tiana shuttered herself off from him, declining to eat lunch with him or hang out after school. One day she stopped showing up entirely. When Tommy asked Mr. Ellsworth where she’d gone, he was told that she ‘returned to where she came from’. 

Tommy was well aware that this was his own fault. His own actions had led to these predictable consequences. Despite the guilt, though, he still couldn’t bring himself to put his neck on the line. He could give the excuse that he was too intimidated by his mother, or that he had too much to lose. The truth was that he was paralyzed by inaction. He’d never taken a stand before, not for himself nor for anyone else, and he didn’t know how to start. So he just did nothing.

Perhaps in the past he would’ve been able to get over it. Your life isn’t at stake. You have prospects. You have a future. Thoughts like these would have served as a balm for the shame. However, now that he’d experienced true friendship for the first time, the absence of Tiana was like a hollow that nothing else could fill. 

Some weeks later, Tommy actually ran into Tiana on campus. His heart jumped; for a moment, he foolishly thought that she was there to talk to him. But one look at her face told him that wasn’t the case. 

“Hi,” he quickly said. She was already turning away from him. “I haven’t seen you in a while.”

“Yeah. You haven’t,” she said blandly. 

“What are you doing here?” Tommy asked, trying to make conversation. 

“I’m getting my stuff from my dorm,” she said. Only then did Tommy notice the suitcase she was wheeling next to her. “I’m leaving.”

“What?” Tommy blinked, not believing his ears. “Why?”

Tiana sent him a scathing glare. “Since you’re so curious, my home has finally flooded. There isn’t much left for my family in Southside, so we’re moving.” 

Tommy gaped, opening and closing his mouth wordlessly. “I… I never wanted this to happen.”

“Of course not. You just wanted everything to magically resolve itself without having to lift a finger.” Tiana sighed and shook her head. The anger seemed to leech out of her, until she just looked exhausted. “I hope staying quiet was worth it.” She grabbed her suitcase and finally left. 

That was the last time Tommy saw her. In the following months, Earthandsea grew. The fishery that was built in Southside greatly increased profits, just like the SOUTHSIDE_44-45 report had predicted. As a result, his daily five minute conversation with his mother turned into brief emails and memos sent through Smithers. The color drained out of his day to day life until he was back to the same monochromatic schedule as before, except now it felt unbearable. 

The seat next to his in class remained empty.
