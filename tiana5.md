## THE FALLING OUT

As promised, Tiana was a quick study. Tommy showed her around the office, pointed out which areas had human workers and which employed AI, and taught her how to use her premade company account to access resources and files. 

Tiana dutifully jotted down notes while she followed him around, stopping every so often to admire novel technologies that were scattered around the office, such as the Holistic Coffee Machine – a self-automated coffee machine, which could infer the customer’s current preference for coffee based on their body temperature, breathing, and heart rate, amongst other factors. 

To Tommy, these items were mundane but Tiana had never seen such efficiency before!

The internship became a new addition to their daily routine; now, instead of going to her dorm room to study after classes ended, she would go to Earthandsea HQ with Tommy. She found herself enjoying her time there. The place that had intimidated her on the first day became a place where fond memories were made, like when the Holistic Coffee Machine malfunctioned and spat coffee all over Tommy. Tiana couldn’t remember any other time she laughed so hard.

After a couple weeks, they found their daily research tasks leading them to one of the many system file rooms at Earthandsea. The few employees inside took one look at them before gathering their items and leaving with respectful nods to Tommy. 

“They’re not going to stay?” Tiana asked. 

“I prefer to work alone, so they know to leave when I’m here.”

Tiana shook her head in amazement, opting to sit down instead of responding. She rolled her chair up in front of one of the massive screens that lined the tables and logged in with her new credentials. “We’re looking for a specific import report?”

“Yeah, that’s our first task.” Tommy unceremoniously plopped into another chair and pulled out his phone. “Search engines don’t have access to the more confidential stuff, so we can’t use AI for this one. We’ll have to look manually.” Despite his continual usage of the word ‘we’, he showed no intentions of working.

“Are you going to help me find this document or what?” asked Tiana.

“I'm training you by letting you spread your wings,” said Tommy. Tiana rolled her eyes, deciding not to bother since he had spent time training her, and started looking through the file system.. 

About half an hour ticked by in the silence of the file room, with Tiana clicking through in search of the report while Tommy passed the time on his phone. Beginning to get fed up with the lack of results, Tiana clicked through a random chain of folders, pausing and backtracking when her eyes snagged on a familiar name. Did I see that right? She clicked back and leaned in when her suspicions were confirmed. The file was labeled SOUTHSIDE_44-45, the name of her neighborhood. 

Southside mentioned here? Tiana was confused, and was torn about whether to have a look. 

Temptation got the best of her, and Tiana decided to open the file. She’d only just begun to skim the first few lines when a frown formed on her face. She couldn’t make sense of what she was reading. Redevelopment? Collateral damage? Necessary project?

“What is all this?” she muttered. Unbeknownst to Tiana, those words were set to activate Smithers’ ever so helpful system. His voice rang out the second she finished her thought, causing her to jump in her seat.

“Hello, Tiana. I can help you with that. The file SOUTHSIDE_44-45 reports plans for another fishery and several hatcheries to be built offshore the Southside area in the upcoming months. To generalize, construction would be greatly beneficial to Earthandsea Co. There would be some collateral damage impacting Southside residents; for example, water contamination, and impacts on the seawall surrounding the neighborhood. However, the benefits of increased production and employment objectively outweigh the costs—” 

“Stop!” Tiana cried out, standing up and slamming her hand on the table. The room was promptly plunged into silence. She stood rigid as she tried to process everything Smithers had just dumped on her. Her mind, which could usually flit through facts and figures with ease, seemed to slog through the information that had been presented to her—perhaps because she was trying to avoid the truth. But after some moments of deliberation, she could ignore it no longer.

Earthandsea was going to destroy Southside. 

“Tiana?” She snapped to attention. Tommy was warily looking at her, no doubt because of her outburst. “What’s wrong?”

Tiana hopelessly looked back at the report, as if she could find some piece of evidence to make the situation more digestible. But nothing made it easier. She was torn between two worlds—Southside and Earthandsea. 

She’d wanted to get away from Southside for as long as she could remember. There were no opportunities there, no connections for her to make, no prestigious schools or academies for her to attend. But at the same time, it was all she’d ever known. It was still her home. 

Earthandsea, on the other hand, had all the power to change her life completely. She could connect with people in high places. She could get a high-paying job. She could turn over a new leaf completely and live as a new Tiana Montgomery, one who didn’t need scholarships to afford school, one who didn’t have an outdated e-notebook, one who wasn’t laughed at by kids in higher places. But Earthandsea was also going to destroy her home. 

If she chose not to do anything, would she be letting Earthandsea wipe out Southside—or worse, play a part in it?

But what could one measly person even do in a situation like this?
