Something. Anything. Tiana gritted her teeth. Even if she was just one measly person, doing anything was better than doing nothing at all.

Tiana looked back up at Tommy. She wasn’t sure what exactly to do yet, but one thing was for sure—if she wanted to get anywhere, she needed Tommy on her side. Not only was he a member of the upper-class, he was directly in line to inherit Earthandsea, making him doubly influential. 

“Did you know about this?” she asked cautiously, pointing to the report. He gave it a cursory glance and shrugged. 

“They’re always building new fisheries. Why?”

Tiana swallowed. The whole reason she’d kept her humble origins a secret was because she didn’t want anyone to know that she was different. She’d wanted to fit in. But if she was going to make any change, she couldn’t keep her head down and keep trying to assimilate. 

“This is my neighborhood,” she said slowly. “I’m from Southside, and this fishery will ruin us.” 

Tommy’s eyes widened into saucers. He glanced between the report and herself in shock. “But—but you said you were from a small town across the country! Why did you lie?” 

“Because… I was ashamed.” Tiana fidgeted with her fingers as she spoke. “I’ve only ever wanted to leave. But maybe Southside can be fixed. Maybe we can be the ones to fix it!” She turned the full force of her gaze onto him, pleading. He looked distinctly uncomfortable. “Don’t you see? There are other factors that caused Southside to be the way it is today, factors that we could stop now!” 

“That’s…” Tommy’s eyes slid away from hers. “I get what you’re saying, but we’re just two people.”

“Come to Southside,” Tiana said, intent on making him at least see it in person. At Tommy’s reluctant expression, she insisted.

“Just for a bit. So you can see everything in person, instead of through a screen. Please?” 

He deliberated for a few seconds, during which Tiana only stared at him harder. Finally, he relented with a sigh. “Alright, fine. I’ll come. But not for too long!”

“Of course!” Tiana said, trying not to whoop in victory. This was a very good first step.
