## Part 1: First Day of School

It was September 5th 2044, the first day of school. Tommy Jones was asleep in a dark, cavernous room. A blaring alarm broke the silence.

“Wake up Mr. Jones, it’s time to get ready for school. The early bird gets the worm!” said a robotically cheerful voice. 

“Ten minutes Smithers!” groaned Tommy.

“Yes Mr. Jones, a ten minute countdown will begin now. Ten minutes, nine minutes fifty-nine seconds, nine minutes fifty-eight sec-” 

“That’s enough Smithers, I’m awake now.”

Smithers had been the family’s butler ever since the Smithers Home Software System had been installed in 2039. He was a highly intelligent AI, capable of doing all sorts of things from event planning to vehicular transportation, but sometimes he was insufferable. 

Tired from studying the previous night, Tommy reluctantly pushed his silk sheets aside and dragged himself out of bed, barely avoiding tripping over his own feet. 

Smithers’ voice continues to echo across Tommy’s room, the background noise to every morning. “Your pressed uniform and tie can be found in the closet. It has been prepared to your mother’s specifications.” 

“Good to know, Smithers,” said Tommy. Most things in his life were prepared to his mother’s specifications. 

With a cheery beep from Smithers, the heavy velvet auto-curtains that shielded his bedroom from light pulled open to reveal a grand view of the valley through tall floor-to-ceiling windows. The blue ocean glittered in the distance. To anyone else, this view would inspire awe. To Tommy, it was just another morning. He yawned and turned away, rubbing at his eyes.

As he got dressed, Tommy took a second to look at his blazer. Embroidered on the left breast pocket with gold thread, it read:

BRIGHTON PREPARATORY ACADEMY 

It was the school Tommy’s mother had always wanted him to attend, and which had subsequently received a significant donation from the Jones Family Foundation just a few months prior to his acceptance. 

He slipped the jacket on and viewed himself in the mirror, turning this way and that. For all the money they’d paid Brighton, their clothes were nothing particularly special.

Downstairs, breakfast was set up in the grand hall. The usual spread of fresh fruit, bread and various pastries covered the length of the table. As usual, there was a single placemat for Tommy at the end of the table. As he nibbled on some toast, he scrolled through his phone idly, switching through various social media apps (none of which he had any messages on) before deciding to look at the news. 

“Breaking news,” said the ONN anchorman. “Yet another flash flood hit the Southside neighborhood just last night, displacing hundreds and causing immense damage to property and livelihoods.” Numerous clips of abject devastation played as the anchor continued, showing upturned cars, wrecked homes, and families huddled on the streets.

Tommy sighed. It was old news. The lowland area of Southside was always flooded. Tommy’s mother told him not to go there for good reason.
