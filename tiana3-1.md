If she was going to be successful at Brighton Prep, Tiana needed to make friends. Taking a deep breath, she decided to introduce herself to the quiet boy next to her. 

“Hi! I’m Tiana,” she said, trying to make confident eye contact with the boy. He seemed confused and almost scared for a minute, avoiding her gaze before responding.

“H-hi, I’m Tommy. Nice to meet you too…” he said with an awkward smile. 

Tommy’s bashful introduction was somehow comforting to Tiana. At least she wasn’t the only one who didn’t feel at ease here. 

Tiana smiled back at him briefly before looking to the front of the class. 

Chatter flowed in class as everyone around them talked to their friends about their summer escapades. Some classmates had gone to Bora Bora, some to Hawaii, and some to the New Maldives, which had been constructed only recently after most of the Old Maldives was submerged. In her lifetime of 14 years, Tiana had never left the state. 

As the clock struck 8 am, the morning bell rang and a lanky, bespectacled man strolled into class. He seemed obscenely happy for someone at work at 8 am.

“Good morning, class!” He somehow sounded even more cheerful than he looked. “I hope you all had a good break. My name is Mr. Ellsworth, and I am going to be your homeroom teacher for your first year here. I hope you are all proud of yourselves; attending this prestigious institution is no small matter. Welcome to Brighton Academy!”

More excited chatter and cheers erupted at his words. Mr. Ellsworth allowed it for a few moments before raising his hands in a placating motion. 

“All right, settle down, everyone,” he said. “Before we begin, I would like to introduce a new student to you all. Most of you already know each other from years prior, but this student has 

earned a scholarship to attend Brighton, and as such, it will be your first time meeting her.” Mr. Ellsworth pushed up his glasses and sniffed. “It’s very rare for outsiders to come to this school.”

Tiana cringed. Did he have to mention the scholarship? 

Whispers sounded around the classroom. Everyone looked around the room for the new student, and eventually all eyes landed on Tiana. 

Even though she was internally horrified, Tiana tried to remain calm. She knew it wouldn’t be easy to assimilate into a school like this, not when she was born different to all these people. 

“Why don’t you introduce yourself, my dear?” Mr. Ellsworth said. 

With a deep breath, Tiana stood up in her seat and braced herself. 

“Hello everyone, I’m Tiana,” she said, her voice ringing out clear as a bell. “Like Mr. Ellsworth said, I’m new here. I'm very happy to be here, and I’m excited to meet you all.”

“Where are you from?” A student in the middle of the room asked. For some reason, this elicited laughter. 

Tiana felt anger well up inside her. She had decided when she got the scholarship that she wouldn’t reveal much about herself to these people. People from Northtown were notorious for looking down on Southsiders. 

“A small town on the other side of the country,” Tiana replied, trying to sound unbothered. “Got any more questions?”

Tiana hoped she’d sounded intimidating enough to discourage further questions. To her relief, she was met with silence. She sat back down and glanced over at Tommy, who looked back at her with a faint look of admiration. 

“You did great,” he said, with a hesitant thumbs up. For some reason, this made Tiana laugh. 

Class launched soon after that. Syllabi were instantaneously shared to everyone’s devices (Tiana’s notebook didn’t support this new feature, so Tommy shared it with her manually), and basic housekeeping was covered. After that, Mr. Ellsworth clapped his hands together. 

“Alright, students. This semester, we will be piloting a very special program for our business classes thanks to the generosity of our local companies. You all will be interning in pairs at an assigned company for a whole month!” 

Excited whispers broke out in class. Tiana’s heart jumped. Finally! It seemed like her joining this school was already coming to use. Success was on the horizon!

“This will be a great experience for you all, but especially those of you who want to work in the world of business,” continued Mr. Ellsworth. “Your assigned companies will be posted online, and your internship starts next week. Best of luck!”

Tiana looked over to Tommy enthusiastically. “I’ve never had an internship before!” exclaimed Tiana. Tommy looked strangely nonchalant about the situation, and only gave a slight smile in response before looking down at his top-of-the-line AirScreen Pro with a grimace. 

“Looks like the company assignments are out.” 

Tiana felt her heart beating with anxiety and anticipation. She scrolled down the page to find her name.

Tiana Montgomery, Tommy Jones : Earthandsea Corporation

“Oh my gosh!” exclaimed Tiana to herself. The Earthandsea Corporation was the largest chain of fisheries and hatcheries on this side of the planet, and one of the few Fortune 500 companies that were headed by women CEOs. It would be a great opportunity for Tiana to learn and advance her opportunities, but it wouldn’t be easy.

As Tiana switched instantaneously between excitement, fear and impostor syndrome, she heard a quiet voice. 

“Looks like we’ve both been assigned to the same company…” said Tommy. Absorbed in her own thoughts, Tiana hadn’t even noticed that Tommy was her internship partner. 

“Oh, nice,” said Tiana. Strangely, it made Tiana feel better to know that she’d be working with Tommy. If anything, at least he wasn’t one of those kids who’d laughed at her. 

Just then, the brunch bell rang. The whole class began to shuffle and quickly pack their belongings, walking out in groups of friends. Tiana sat frozen in her seat for a moment. Realistically, she would probably be having brunch and lunch alone, since she didn’t know anyone. 

She looked over at her tablemate Tommy, who looked similarly hesitant. 

“Do you know what food is good here?” asked Tommy, twiddling his thumbs. “Oh—unless you already have plans…” 

Tiana found Tommy’s awkward efforts to make friends with her oddly heartwarming. 

“I don’t. Do you?”

Tommy shook his head. “I guess we can find out together.”
