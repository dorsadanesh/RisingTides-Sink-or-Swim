If she was going to be successful at Brighton Prep, Tiana needed to make friends. Taking a deep breath, she decided to introduce herself to the quiet boy next to her. 

“Hi! I’m Tiana,” she said, trying to make confident eye contact with the boy. He seemed confused and almost scared for a minute, avoiding her gaze before responding.

“H-hi, I’m Tommy. Nice to meet you too…” he said with an awkward smile. 

Tommy’s bashful introduction was somehow comforting to Tiana. At least she wasn’t the only one who didn’t feel at ease here. 

Tiana smiled back at him briefly before looking to the front of the class.
