It was September 5th, 2044, the first day of school. Faint rays of light poked through the blinds of Tiana Montgomery’s room, where she lay in bed. Tiana’s vintage AppleTM phone alarm rang, but she was already awake, staring at the ceiling. 

Just then, there was a knock at the door. Tiana stayed still as her mother cracked the door open.

“Tiana, wake up sweetheart. You don’t wanna be late on your big first day!” said Tiana’s mother as she walked over and gently patted her head. 

“I’m already up, Mom,” said Tiana, moving her mother’s hand aside in mild annoyance. 

It was her first day at her new school, Brighton Preparatory Academy. Tiana had been looking forward to this day with equal parts anxiety and eagerness ever since she’d won the full ride scholarship to the institution nearly two months ago. Last week, she’d visited the campus with her parents to move her belongings into her dorm room, where she’d be staying during the school year. The academy’s grounds were endless, with state-of-the-art facilities, perfectly green lawns, and freshly paved walkways. 

Her little family of three had doubtlessly stuck out like a sore thumb as they’d navigated the campus. It was clear that there was no way they would have been able to pay out of pocket for her tuition to attend a private school of Brighton’s caliber. 

Tiana sat up in bed as her mother pulled her school uniform out of the little closet and laid it across the bed. Once Tiana put on that uniform and walked onto campus, she hoped she would blend right in. Scholarship or not. 

“Come have breakfast with us when you’re ready,” said Tiana’s mother. Tiana simply nodded as she wiped the sleep out of her eyes. She walked over to the window and raised the blinds to reveal the view of the Southside neighborhood. A few streets over, Tiana could see the blue ocean and the crumbling seawall that was supposed to hold it at bay, though it never did. She could also see some of the homes that had been flooded in the recent series of high tide incidents. Tiana’s apartment block was on a slight hill, so it rarely flooded, although sometimes with heavy rain there were leakage issues. 

It was odd to think that she wouldn’t have to think about leakage issues anymore—at least not while she was dorming at Brighton, which was in the more affluent neighborhood of Northtown.

As Tiana put on her school uniform, she couldn’t help but feel out of place. The look of her in a gold embroidered school blazer was just…strange. But, it was something she would have to get used to if she wanted to improve her future prospects. As stuffy as it was, this uniform was about to open a whole new world of upward mobility. 

After psyching herself up in the mirror, Tiana stepped into the kitchen/living room/dining room of her apartment to see her parents sitting at the table, engaged in a discussion that seemed serious. Neither of them noticed Tiana standing in the corner. 

“The recent boats all came back empty. We can’t keep the restaurant going without fish,” said Tiana’s father in a low voice, concern creasing his features. 

“I’m sure it’s just a fluke,” replied Tiana’s mother, although she didn’t seem to believe her own words.
