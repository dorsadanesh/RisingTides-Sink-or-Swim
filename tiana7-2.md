The journey back home felt much longer than when she’d left for Brighton. Out the window of the trolley speeding on its tracks, Tiana watched as upscale shopping districts and sleek cars transformed into smaller buildings, weedy lawns, and old manual vehicles running on broken up streets. 

It was the same Southside she’d always known. The place she both loved and couldn’t stand.

Tiana got off at her stop and began the walk to her house. She passed the same house that the reporter van had been in front of on the first day of school. The van was gone now, but the house was the same, debris scattered around the muddy lawn and a portion of the waterlogged porch caving into the front entrance. 

Collateral damage. To Earthandsea, this would just be a necessary loss for a greater project. And why not bear that loss? The only ones facing the consequences would be the people in Southside, who had no other choice.

Tiana wrenched her gaze away from the house and continued on. She’d hoped that walking around would help the churning in her gut, but if anything, it only got worse the closer she got to home. When she finally reached her house, her parents were waiting at the front step. Her mother ran down the steps and pulled Tiana into a tight hug before she could get a word out. 

“Welcome back,” her mother said, words muffled. She pulled back and smiled brightly at Tiana, looking her over. “Have you been eating well? Oh, you look so tired! I hope they don’t work you too hard. Here, give me your bag.” She slipped Tiana’s backpack off her shoulder and started back into the house. “Come on, I’ll make you your favorite for dinner.” 

Tiana wordlessly followed her mother. Her father pulled her into another hug as they made their way inside. Somehow, the apartment felt smaller than Tiana remembered, though she’d only been away for about a month. The dining table took up most of the space by the entrance, and Tiana had to squeeze her way around. 

She took a quick shower while her parents made dinner. When she went outside, the aroma hanging in the air made her mouth water. Her suspicions were confirmed when she exited the hallway and saw the dining table. 

“Crispy skin salmon and stir fry,” her mother proudly said. “Bet they don’t make this at your fancy school.” 

“They don’t,” Tiana agreed, sitting down at her seat. She wanted to dig in right away, but her stomach turned at the sight of the meal. Instead of taking a bite, what came out of her mouth was, “Was it hard getting the fish?”

Her parents both paused, exchanging a glance with each other. “What?”

“I mean…” Tiana swallowed. “Fish is… hard to come by, right? Let alone salmon.”

Her parents exchanged another glance before her father placed his hand over hers. “Don’t worry about that,” he said firmly. “Your mother and I can handle all that. You just eat and enjoy.” 

Finding herself lost for words, Tiana simply nodded and picked up her fork. Weren’t her father’s words reminiscent of what she’d thought before? Her parents always managed to figure things out somehow. 

Except they didn’t know what Earthandsea was planning. They didn’t know Southside would soon be practically uninhabitable. Only she knew.

Tiana began eating, but she couldn’t taste anything at all. 

The next morning, she woke up before her alarm went off. For some reason, she hadn’t been able to sleep well, and her stomach was still acting up. Maybe I need medicine. 

She crept into the hallway, intending to get something to eat with the medicine, but stopped short as she saw her parents sitting at the dining table. The restaurant was closed on Saturdays. Why were they up so early? 

She inched closer and tried to get a look at what they were doing. They were both bent over the table, which was scattered with papers. Tiana’s mother had a hand to her temple. 

“The boats keep coming back empty,” her father said.

“Can we get fish from somewhere else? Maybe from up north?”

“They overcharge,” her father said bitterly. “At that point, we’ll be running a loss.”

“We could limit our menu for the time being,” her mother suggested. “Have less seafood dishes, and more vegetable based ones.”

“Who’s going to go to a seafood restaurant for vegetable dishes?”

At that moment, Tiana shifted her weight, causing the floorboards to creak. Her parents whipped around and their eyes widened upon seeing her. 

“Tiana! You’re up so early!” Her mother jumped up. “Are you hungry?”

“Yes, maybe we should have an early breakfast,” her father said as he rapidly gathered all the papers together. “It’s been a while since we did that, hasn’t it?”

“It has,” her mother agreed, “come on, sit down and I’ll—”

“Stop,” Tiana said. Her mother froze in place. “I… I know what you’re trying to do.”

“What? What am I doing?”

“Distracting me,” Tiana said, pointing at the papers in her father’s hands. “The restaurant isn’t doing well, is it?”

“That’s not your job to worry about,” her father replied, tucking the papers away into a folder. “You just focus on school, understand?”

Tiana felt that same spike in her gut, but it was only then that she truly understood what she was feeling, and why she’d been feeling this way ever since she first came across that file. It was guilt. 

But what good was guilt? It wasn’t as if she could do anything. What was done was done; Earthandsea would be building their fishery, and Southside would pay the price. That was just the way the world worked. She ought to just go back to school now and get back to studying.

Tiana faltered as she looked at her parents’ expectant faces.

## CHOICE: Ignore guilt and go back to school or stay in southside for a bit and look around
